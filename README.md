In order to install osTicket on a Windows 10 machine, it is necessary to enable IIS (Internet Information Services) with CGI (Common Gateway Interface). CGI is a standard protocol that allows web servers to interface with executable programs or scripts. osTicket uses PHP, a server-side scripting language, to function, and PHP requires CGI to work properly. Therefore, enabling IIS with CGI is crucial for osTicket to run smoothly.
  
To install the PHP manager, we need to first download it from the Microsoft website. Once we have downloaded the PHP manager, we can run the installation file and follow the prompts to install it on our machine.

Next, we need to install the IIS URL Rewrite Module 2 for osTicket to work properly. The URL Rewrite Module allows us to rewrite URLs on the fly, which is important for osTicket as it uses clean URLs to function. Clean URLs are human-readable URLs that are easier to remember and share. The IIS URL Rewrite Module 2 allows us to convert dynamic URLs generated by osTicket into clean URLs that can be understood by both humans and search engines. To install the IIS URL Rewrite Module 2, we need to download it from the Microsoft website and run the installation file.

<p>
Now we will install PHP itself. To do this, create a brand new folder on the C Drive titled "PHP", then download the latest version of PHP from the official PHP website and extract its contents to the "PHP" folder. This folder will contain all the necessary PHP files needed for osTicket to function correctly.

Before we can start using PHP, we need to make sure that the C++ Redistributable is installed on our virtual machine. To install the C++ Redistributable, we need to download it from the Microsoft website and run the installation file. Once the installation is complete, we can proceed with setting up and configuring PHP for osTicket.

Next, we need to install a MySQL server. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system used to store and manage data. osTicket requires MySQL to store all the ticket-related information. When installing MySQL, we can opt for a typical setup, which includes the installation of the MySQL server, client, and other necessary components.
  
After the installation, we should launch the MySQL Server Configuration Wizard to set up the database server. We can choose the "standard configuration" option, which sets up the server for general-purpose use. During the configuration process, we should take note of the password used to set up the MySQL server as we will need that later on to configure osTicket (Username = "root"). With MySQL installed and configured, we can now proceed with installing and configuring osTicket on our virtual machine.

</p>
<p>
To register the PHP version with IIS, we can use the PHP manager we installed earlier. To do this, we need to first open IIS Manager by searching for it in the system search bar and running it as an administrator. Once in the IIS Manager console, we can navigate to the PHP manager and select the "Register new PHP version" option. Here, we need to browse to the "php-cgi.exe" file located in the PHP folder on the C drive that we created earlier. 
  
Once we have selected the file, we can complete the registration process by navigating back to "osTicket Home" and restarting the server on the right side under "Actions". With PHP now registered with IIS, we can proceed with configuring osTicket to use PHP and MySQL.

</p>
<p>
Now that we have IIS, PHP, and MySQL set up, we can proceed with the installation of osTicket. To install osTicket, we need to first download the latest version from the official osTicket website. Once we have downloaded the file, we can extract the contents of the zip file and copy the "upload" folder to the "c:\inetpub\wwwroot" directory. After copying the "upload" folder, we need to rename it to "osTicket". This is the directory where osTicket will be installed and served from. With osTicket installed, we can now access it from a web browser and start using it to manage our ticketing system.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
To access osTicket, we need to navigate to the IIS Manager console and select the "Default" site. Under the "Default" site, we should see the "osTicket" folder that we created earlier. Once we have located the "osTicket" folder, we need to click on it to open its settings. On the right-hand side, we should see an option to "Browse *:80", which we need to click to open osTicket in our web browser. This will launch osTicket and we can start using it to manage our ticketing system.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When you first open osTicket, you may notice that some extensions aren't enabled. To enable the required extensions, we can go back to the IIS Manager console and navigate to the "Default" site, then click on the "osTicket" folder. Next, we should double-click the "PHP Manager" option and select "Enable or disable an extension". Here, we need to enable the following extensions: "php_imap.dll", "php_intl.dll", and "php_opcache.dll". After enabling these extensions, we should refresh the osTicket site in our web browser to observe the changes. With the required PHP extensions enabled, we should now be able to use osTicket without any issues.

</p>
<p>
The next step is to rename the "ost-sampleconfig.php" file to "ost-config.php". To do this, we need to navigate to the "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include" directory and locate the "ost-sampleconfig.php" file. We need to rename this file to "ost-config.php" to ensure that osTicket can use the configuration file.

After renaming the file, we need to assign appropriate permissions to it. We can do this by disabling inheritance and removing all permissions, then adding a new permission for "Everyone" with "All" permissions. This will ensure that osTicket can access the configuration file and read and write data as needed. We should now be able to continue setting up osTicket in our web browser. Navigate to the osTicket site and click on the "Continue" button.

Next, we need to enter a name for our helpdesk in the designated field. This can be anything that helps us easily identify our helpdesk, such as the name of our organization or the department that the helpdesk serves.

Finally, we need to enter a default email address in the appropriate field. This email address will be used to receive emails from customers who submit tickets through the osTicket system. It is important to ensure that the email address is correct and actively monitored to ensure timely responses to customer inquiries. Once we have entered the required information, the next step is to setup our database before we continue from here.

<p>
Download and install HeidiSQL, then open the application and create a new session. We can do this by clicking on the "New" button in the toolbar and entering the credentials for our MySQL database. In most cases, the default login credentials are "root" for the username and "Password1" for the password.

After creating a new session, we need to connect to it. Once connected, we can create a new database called "osTicket". To do this, we can right-click on the main window and select "Create new" > "Database". We should then enter "osTicket" as the database name and click on the "OK" button to create the new database. With the database created, we can now finish setting up osTicket. Click "Install Now" on the webpage.

<p>
We have now successfully completed the install of osTicket. Before concluding, we need to undertake a few clean-up steps. Firstly, the "setup" folder at C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup, which contains sensitive information, should be deleted to prevent potential security compromises.

Secondly, it is recommended to set the permission of the "ost-config.php" file located at C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php to "Read" only to prevent unauthorized changes. This step is crucial for ensuring the security of your osTicket installation.

With these final steps completed, your osTicket installation is now fully operational and secure.
